# 🚀 Code Review RAG System

An intelligent automated code review system powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), semantic analysis, and risk-aware context compression.

This project builds a modular AI architecture that analyzes source code, detects potential risks, retrieves relevant best practices, and generates structured code review feedback using LLMs.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Traditional code reviews are:

- slow
- inconsistent
- dependent on reviewer experience

This system aims to:

✅ Automate code review workflows  
✅ Compress large code contexts intelligently  
✅ Provide fast, accurate feedback  
✅ Apply best-practice knowledge dynamically via RAG
