# Clean Code Principles

- Functions should do one thing only.
- Prefer descriptive variable names.
- Avoid deeply nested loops or conditions.
- Keep functions small and readable.
- Avoid magic numbers; use constants.
- Remove unused variables or imports.
- Write self-documenting code.

Code smells:
- Large functions (>50 lines)
- Repeated code blocks
- Excessive comments explaining obvious code.
